                Chapter 2 of NEB Grade 11 Computer Science dives into the fundamental ways computers represent and
                process information. It starts with Number Systems, exploring the decimal (base-10) system we use daily,
                and then moves to the crucial binary (base-2) system, which computers directly understand, using only 0s
                and 1s. Students learn about other systems like octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) and, most
                importantly, how to convert numbers between these different bases.

                The second key part is Boolean Logic, which is the basis of digital circuit design. This involves
                understanding Boolean algebra, including concepts like logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), truth tables,
                and logic gates. These gates (like AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate) are the building blocks of all digital
                electronic circuits within a computer, allowing it to perform logical operations and make decisions. The
                chapter explains how these abstract logical concepts translate into the physical components of a
                computer.</p>
