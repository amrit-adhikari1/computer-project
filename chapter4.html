                Word Processing Software: Such as Microsoft Word. It explains the basic features like creating, editing,
                formatting, and saving documents, working with text, paragraphs, pages, tables, images, and printing.
                Spreadsheet Software: Such as Microsoft Excel. This section covers creating and managing worksheets,
                entering data, using formulas and functions for calculations, creating charts and graphs, and basic data
                analysis.
                Presentation Software: Such as Microsoft PowerPoint. It focuses on designing and delivering
                presentations, including creating slides, adding text, images, multimedia, animations, and transitions,
                and presenting information effectively.
                Database Management System (DBMS) Software: While a full DBMS course is often in Grade 12, Chapter 4 in
                Grade 11 might introduce the concept of simple database applications like Microsoft Access, explaining
                basic terms like tables, fields, records, and queries.</p>
