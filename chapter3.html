                System Software is explored in detail, with a primary focus on the Operating System (OS). The chapter
                covers the definition of an OS, its crucial role in managing computer resources (like memory, CPU, and
                peripherals), and its various functions, such as process management, file management, memory management,
                and device management. It also discusses how the OS provides a user interface (GUI or CUI) and enables
                different programs to run. Common OS terminologies like multiprogramming, multitasking, and
                multiprocessing are introduced. The chapter often delves into specific examples of operating systems,
                including GUI-based systems like Windows, and how to perform basic tasks like managing files and folders
                within such environments.

                Beyond the OS, Utility Software (e.g., antivirus programs, disk cleanup tools) and Device Drivers
                (software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware) are also discussed as vital components of
                system software.

                Finally, the chapter briefly touches upon Application Software, defining it as programs designed to
                perform specific tasks for users, such as word processing, spreadsheets, and web Browse, setting the
                stage for more detailed discussions in subsequent chapters.</p>
