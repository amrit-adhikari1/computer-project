                Building upon HTML from Chapter 6, Chapter 7 delves into making web pages visually appealing and
                interactive. The primary focus is on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which controls the presentation and
                layout of web content.

                Students learn:

                The concept of CSS and its separation from HTML structure.
                Ways to apply CSS:
                Inline CSS (using the style attribute directly within HTML tags).
                Internal CSS (using the style tag within the head section of an HTML document).
                External CSS (linking to an external .css file using the link tag in the head section), emphasizing its
                benefits for larger websites.
                Basic CSS properties and values for styling, including:
                Colors: color, background-color.
                Text formatting: font-family, font-size, text-align.
                Dimensions: width, height.
                Box Model concepts: margin, padding, border.</p>
