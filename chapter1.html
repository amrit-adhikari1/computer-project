            <strong> NOTES</strong>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes raw data into meaningful information via an
                Input-Process-Output (IPO) cycle. Key characteristics include high speed, accuracy, diligence,
                versatility, and vast storage capacity. Computers are indispensable across all sectors, from homes to
                healthcare and education.

                Computer evolution is marked by generations:

                1st (Vacuum Tubes): Huge, slow, costly, used machine language.
                2nd (Transistors): Smaller, faster; introduced assembly language.
                3rd (Integrated Circuits - ICs): Significantly smaller, faster; led to Operating Systems.
                4th (Microprocessors/VLSI): Enabled Personal Computers (PCs), GUIs, and the internet.
                5th (AI/ULSI): Focus on intelligent systems, natural language processing.
                Computer processing speed is measured in Hertz (e.g., GHz), while storage capacity uses bits and bytes
                (KB, MB, GB, TB, where 1 KB = 1024 Bytes).

                Types of computers vary by power and size:

                Supercomputers: Extremely fast, for complex scientific tasks.
                Mainframe Computers: Large, powerful, for critical business operations (e.g., banking).
                Minicomputers: Mid-range, for departmental use.
                Microcomputers (PCs): Personal use (desktops, laptops, smartphones).
                Mobile Computing: Using devices on the go (smartphones, tablets).
                The Computer Architecture follows a block diagram:

                Input Unit: Takes data in (Keyboard, Mouse).
                Output Unit: Displays results (Monitor, Printer, Speaker).
                Central Processing Unit (CPU): The "brain" that executes instructions. It comprises the Arithmetic Logic
                Unit (ALU) for calculations, the Control Unit (CU) for managing operations, and Registers for temporary
                storage. CPU speed is measured by Clock Speed (GHz) and Word Length (e.g., 64-bit).
                Memory Unit: Stores data.
                Primary Memory (RAM, ROM, Cache): Fast, directly accessible by CPU. RAM is volatile.
                Secondary Memory (HDD, SSD): Slower, non-volatile, for long-term storage.
                Bus System: Electronic pathways (Data, Address, Control buses) for component communication.
                Hardware Interfaces (e.g., USB, HDMI, Parallel/Serial ports) allow external devices to connect and
                communicate with the computer.</p>
