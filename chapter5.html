                A significant part of this chapter is dedicated to problem-solving techniques in programming. This
                includes:

                Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures for solving a problem, emphasizing characteristics like finiteness,
                definiteness, and effectiveness.
                Flowcharts: Graphical representations of algorithms using standard symbols, which help visualize the
                flow of logic.
                The chapter then introduces basic programming constructs, often using a simple high-level language (like
                C, which is commonly introduced in NEB Grade 11). Key concepts covered include:

                Variables and data types: How data is stored and categorized.
                Operators: Symbols used to perform operations (arithmetic, relational, logical).
                Control structures:
                Sequential statements: Instructions executed one after another.
                Selection/Conditional statements: (e.g., if, if-else, switch) for making decisions.
                Iteration/Looping statements: (e.g., for, while, do-while) for repeating tasks.
                Arrays: Simple data structures for storing collections of similar data.</p>
