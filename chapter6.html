                The bulk of the chapter focuses on HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the foundational language for
                creating web content. Students learn the basic structure of an HTML document using tags like html, head,
                and body.

                Key HTML elements covered include:

                Structuring content: h1 to h6 for headings, p for paragraphs, br for line breaks.
                Text formatting: b for bold, i for italics, u for underline.
                Media and links: img for inserting images, a for creating hyperlinks.
                Lists: ol for ordered lists, ul for unordered lists.
                Tables: table, tr (table row), td (table data), th (table header) for tabular data.
                Forms: form, input, textarea, button for user input.
                HTML5 basics: A brief introduction to tags like audio and video for multimedia.
                This chapter equips students with the practical skills to construct simple, static web pages using HTML,
                forming the groundwork for future web development studies.</p>
